I'm a developer in Switzerland, currently working at **Swisscom** on data intensive applications, turning
TiBs of network telemetry data into insights.

I'm interested in distributed systems, data engineering, and functional programming.

Previously:
- **Blue Brain Project** at EPFL where I contributed to the development of the [Blue Brain Nexus](https://bluebrainnexus.io) platform.
- **Here Technologies** in Berlin where I worked on services for connected cars.
- **Samsung Electronics** in Korea where I worked on various things related to mobile devices, mostly on the backend side.
